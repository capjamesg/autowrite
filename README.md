# AutoWrite

AutoWrite is a context-aware autocomplete developed with [surprisals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content) (information content).

Given an article of text, AutoWrite generates an autocomplete system that works with unigrams (single words), bigrams (two word phrases), and trigrams (three word phrases).

AutoWrite can also fix the spelling of words that appear in the given article.
